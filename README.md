# Sp00ki
A halloween ghost paranormal thingy, only exists if you go to Los Santos Cementery.

## How to Install?
NOTE: MAKE SURE YOUR SERVER VERSION IS 0.3.DL OTHERWISE IT WON'T WORK!!!!!!!!!! uwu

Put sp00ki.pwn into filterscript folder, then compile it.
Edit your server.cfg like this

```
filterscripts Sp00ki
plugins streamer
useartwork 1
```

Don't forget install streamer and Visual C++ Redistribute 2015 in order to make it work.
If you found error just fix it yourself or you help me fixing by making "pull requests" or just  make "issues"

Ah if you're using my bare, ESC > Map > Right Click on "Los Santos Cementery" and it will teleport you immediately.

## FAQ
Q: Why using Object?

A: I'm using "player object" to make sure the ghost only appears on single player (can be more if someone enters the cementery but still they can't see your ghost)
