# Sp00ki
A halloween ghost paranormal thingy, only exists if you go to Los Santos Cementery.

## How to Install?
Put sp00ki.pwn into filterscript folder, then compile it.
Edit your server.cfg like this

plugins streamer
```

Don't forget install streamer and Visual C++ Redistribute 2015 in order to make it work.
If you have issues just fix it yourself, lmao jk you can create issues or just help me fixing by make "pull requests"

Ah if you're using my bare, ESC > Map > Right Click on "Los Santos Cementery" and it will teleport you immediately.
